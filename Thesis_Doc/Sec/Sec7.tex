\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

Our model attempts to estimate a component of teacher grading which is not associated with human capital accumulation. We found evidence for a wide distribution of this type of effect, which had slight potential links to course taking patterns and later test scores, but few links to long-term outcomes besides these. This raises an additional question of what this grading-effect may measure, questions we hope to identify by adding additional data and refining the methodology of this project.
